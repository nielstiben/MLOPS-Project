### Overall goal of the project
The goal of the project is to use natural language processing to create a model that would predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not.
### What framework are you going to use (Kornia, Transformer, Pytorch-Geometrics)
Since we chose a natural language processing problem, we plan to use the Transformers framework (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
### How to you intend to include the framework into your project
### What data are you going to run on (initially, may change)
We are using the Kaggle dataset Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview). Each sample in the train and test set has the following information: a unique identifier, the text of a tweet, a keyword from that tweet (although this may be blank) and the location the tweet was sent from (may also be blank) and a target value whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0).
### What deep learning models do you expect to use
